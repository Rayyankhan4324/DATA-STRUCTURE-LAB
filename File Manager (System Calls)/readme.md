# 📁 File Manager in C++ (Using Linux System Calls)

This project is a **menu-driven File Manager application** implemented in **C++** using **Linux system calls**.  
It demonstrates low-level file handling operations such as creating, writing, reading, deleting, copying, and backing up files.

This project is ideal for **Operating Systems (OS) Lab**, **System Programming**, and **File Handling practice**.
