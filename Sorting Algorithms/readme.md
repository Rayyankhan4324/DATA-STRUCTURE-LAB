# 🎓 Student Record Management System (C++ Linked List)

This project is a **C++ console-based application** that manages student academic records using a **Singly Linked List**.  
It reads data from a file, stores it dynamically, sorts students based on **CGPA and Credits**, and generates a **ranked output file**.

## 📌 Features

- 📂 Reads student records from a text file
- 🔗 Uses **Singly Linked List** for dynamic data storage
- 🔁 Clones the linked list to preserve original data
- 📊 Sorts students by:
  - **CGPA (Descending)**
  - **Credits (Descending) if CGPA is equal**
- 🏆 Generates a ranked list of students
- 🧹 Proper memory management using destructor
- ❌ Ignores invalid records automatically
